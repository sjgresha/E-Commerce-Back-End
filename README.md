# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
This challenge I had to make an application that would create a backend for an ecommerce site. I had to alter the models and api routes that were initially given to make the application functional. There are still routes and bugs that need to be worked on and I hope to finish them in the near future. Once the bugs are worked out a walkthrough video will be added.
